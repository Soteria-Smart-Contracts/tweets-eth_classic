## Rules

The `@eth_classic` account was the main verified Twitter account for ETC, and we hope to once again build up a following and reputation that keeps that would dignify it with verified status in the future. Tweets from submitted to this should take this into consideration and remain professional, relevant and neutral. 

If you want your submitted tweet to be approved, the contents of the tweet must follow the following rules. If the tweet you wish to submit does not follow these rules, check out the [`@ETC_Network`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/tweets-ETC_Network) account, which has a more relaxed set of rules and may allow the tweet you wish to post, including memes and other content that drives engagement.

If you have suggestions to amend these rules, please create a new issue in this repository.

### Basics

All tweets must conform to the Twitter rules and policies found at https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies. Additionally;

- Dignity: No obscenities, explicit language, racism, sexism, etc.
- Neutrality: No attacking or promoting of non-ETC projects, no drama.
- Seriousness: No memes, jokes, quips, hot takes, etc.
- Accuracy: No linking to overly opinionated, biased or unverifiable information.
- Relevance: No spam, non-ETC related content, limit tweets about the same topic.
- Safety: No links to scams, no encouraging the purchase of assets.

### Content

The `eth_classic` account serves to inform itâ€™s followers in an unbiased way about interesting happening in the Ethereum Classic world. It is a pillar of neutrality, a honey badger that does not care about external drama, and serves to inform others about itâ€™s own situation, protocol updates, and other relevant news.

Tweets from this account should written from the point of view of the ETC blockchain itself. If a proposed tweet can't pass a test of "If it had a voice, would the chain itself say..." then that tweet would not be acceptable.

Acceptable topics to Tweet about include but are not limited to:

- Important development updates such as Hard Fork announcements.
- ETC philosophy and principles, and their benefits, quotes from the website.
- Benefits of ETC technical properties (such as PoW, Sound Money) compared to other blockchains (but must not â€˜dunkâ€™ on other projects).
- Keeping followers in the loop about important community discussions (e.g. ECIPs, ongoing debates).
- Community events, conferences, meetups, initiatives, discussions.
- Interesting technical analysis of network attributes such as hashrate, throughput, price movement.
- Ecosystem updates, new projects, wallets, services, exchange listings (see next below).

### Third Party Projects

- Must be relevant to ETC.
- Projects from **large and established** projects (e.g. Binance listing Tether-ETC pair, Chainlink deploys to ETC, etc.) can be (re)tweeted without disclaimers.
- Projects from **small lesser known** project must be linked to via the website, which includes a disclaimer, must include a disclaimer within the tweet.

### Retweets
